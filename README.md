# Neural-Networks-Deep-learning-
Constructing a Neural Network from Scrath without using any algorithms like Tenfor Flow,.
Used already existing libraries like numpys,scikit learn, seaborn, mathplotlib.pyplot
used random unform distributions for weights and biases and the inputs are two where as the outputs are 1.
the graph between the outputs and targets shows a linear line  and the output value slowlydecreases but after a certain number of iterations the values remain almost the same with trivial change in the value.
